My name is Matheus Alves Nunes from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I'm a Jr. web developer with focus in front-end technologies.

My main programming language is JavaScript and I like to work with React and Vue.

I love music, and playing my favourite songs in the guitar :guitar: is a refuge for me.

Science and technology always fascinated me and I found in IT/programming a place where my curiosity about how things work is rewarded.

My favourite authors are people that put all of their heart and emotions in their work such as Hermann Hesse (Demian, Siddhartha, Steppenwolf, The Glass Bead Game), Bach and Hideaki Anno (Neon Genesis Evangelion).
